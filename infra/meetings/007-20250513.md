## Agenda
* 1.) Release 1.18 review
* 2.) Release process optimization
* 3.) Python 3.14
* 4.) ONNX 1.19 ? 

### 1.) Release 1.18 review ###
Feedback of Krishna:
* a) dedicated release team will potentials for errors, ... [Proposal by Andreas: Release team consists of a) Release manager, release before (1.18), current release (1.19), next release (1.20), b) Andreas, Justin => about 5-6 people] 
* b) Partner repos testing
    * pytorch/onnxruntime tested
    * 1.18.0 breaks at onnxmltools? (tools under github.com/onnx should not break...)
    * Better handling breaking changes...?

### 2. Release process optimization ###
* publish rc-candidates to https://pypi.org/project/onnx/ instead of https://test.pypi.org/project/onnx/ ?
* How do we want to ensure that no incorrect versions are sent to pypi?

### 3. Python 3.14 support ###
* Python 3.14 release beginning of October (https://peps.python.org/pep-0745/) 
  * Andreas: I would prefer to release a version with wheels immediately afterwards
  * Target version: 1.19.0? or do we want to make a version before that?

### 4. ONNX 1.19 ##
* Appointment of a release manager Yuan Yao

### Release Cadence Suggestion (Andreas) ###
