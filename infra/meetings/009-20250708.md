## Agenda
* 1.) Release 1.19, Release Cut in July [Andreas]

## Possible topics
* Testing in ONNX (Christian)
* pixi for faster builds/checks in our CI-pipelines [Christian]
* Introduce ml_dtypes as a dependency (https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/6605) [Justin]
* pypi organization
* github enterprise organization
* Proposal of Saurabh
  * Introduce "Orthogonal and Intermediate release cycles for function sets": Allow for ONNX releases that are not tied to major opset version updates but "function sets". Functions that are decomposable into existing native ops. This is important to cut TTM for ONNX based model deployment on devices (CPU, GPU, specialized accelerators aka NPU).
  * Implement "Function Set Versioning: Create a versioning system for ONNX function sets, analogous to the current opset versioning, to improve tracking and management of function library updates.
  * Streamline the Function Release Process: Ensure the contribution process for new or updated functions is efficient and does not deter contributors with unnecessary delays or complexity. I would lean towards an automated review and approval process for function releases. (Without human involvement)
